Clone

A clone creates a local copy of a repository on your computer.
Cloning downloads the entire project, including all files, branches, and commit history.

After cloning, you can edit files, make commits, and push changes back to GitHub if you have permission.

Example command:

git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
